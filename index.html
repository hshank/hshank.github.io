                    <p id = "int">My team and I created from scratch an application called Tennis Tracker, a wearable-centric app designed to help tennis players measure their progress and track their practice sessions using real-time data. Players use a watch interface and voice commands to track whether strokes are "in", "wide", "long" or "net" in real time during practice sessions, and can review data for an individual practice session, or a stroke over time on the phone. Using this combination of real-time speech tracking and meaningful data visualizations, Tennis Tracker aims to allow athletes to isolate areas that need improvement more efficiently, and use data to solidify an athlete's progress over time. </p>
